# SWG Authentication for Wordpress

# Usage:
- Place `swgauth.php` in `wp-content/plugins/swgauth/`
- Activate the plugin in the Wordpress admin panel
- Point your external auth to `http://url.to.wordpress/?action=swgauth`
- Done!

# Notes:
- Existing users should make a Wordpress account with the _same username_ that they were already using in order to gain access to their existing characters
- HTTPS is reccomended to avoid sending packets that contain plaintext passwords
